This is a repo containing C++ Projects assignments I have done in the CS106X material, a course provided by Stanford University. I went through the course materials in a months time to understand Data structures and algorithms, and Object-oriented programming.

List of Projects:
1. Fauxtoshop - An object-oriented image editor
2. Word Ladder - A simple program that creates word ladder
3. Marble Solitaire - A recursive implementation of a solution finder for the game, Marble Solitaire
4. Boggle - An implementation of the game Boggle
5. Priority Queue - Three implementations of the Priority Queue Class
6. Huffman Encoding - An implementation of Huffman Encoding
7. Trailblazer - Implementation of path finding algorithms and minimum spanning tree algorithms
8. Spreadsheet MVC - An implementation of a spreadsheet clone using MVC pattern design.
